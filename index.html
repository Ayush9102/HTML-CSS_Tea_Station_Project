                American restaurants and workplaces typically offer machine-made drip brew coffee by default, while hot tea brewed by the cup with tea bags is available by request. Tea parties can be celebrated for many occasions, from the very small and intimate to the large family gatherings and celebrations. In the U.S. south a regional favorite called sweet tea  which is brewed, sweetened, and chilled in advance of consumption may be served at all meals and throughout the day as an alternate to other beverages. In the United States, about 85% of the tea consumed is served cold, or iced. Iced tea is more frequently consumed during periods of hot weather or in lower latitudes, and hot tea is likewise more common in colder weather. Any confusion when one is visiting different parts of the country can easily be solved by explicitly asking for either "hot tea" or "iced tea."

                Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Myanmar.[3][4][5] Tea is also rarely made from the leaves of Camellia taliensis.[6][7][8] After plain water, tea is the most widely consumed drink in the world.[9] There are many different types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,[10] while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes.

                Tea contains a moderate amount of caffeine, which can give you the energy you need when youâ€™re feeling sluggish. Tea is also a healthy alternative to other caffeinated beverages like coffee and energy drinks. Unlike other caffeinated drinks, people often experience the effects of caffeinated tea differently, reporting a more sustained energizing effect, rather than the high and crash often associated with energy-boosting beverages. This is partly due to a unique compound present in tea called l-theanine, which promotes calm, relaxation, and focus. Herbal tea ingredients like peppermint and ginger can also provide a stimulating, energizing effect for those who are trying to steer clear of caffeine entirely.

                <p class="about-text">An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the third century AD, in a medical text written by Chinese physician Hua Tuo. It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking subsequently spread to other East Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century. During the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among the English, who started to plant tea on a large scale in British India.</p>
